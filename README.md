## Overview

In the world of 3D printing, ensuring the smooth operation of printers is crucial for continued productivity. This repository introduces a Predictive Maintenance System that utilizes AI algorithms, machine learning models, and Python programming to predict and prevent potential maintenance issues before they escalate.

By analyzing historical data, monitoring real-time sensor information, and leveraging the power of computer vision with OpenCV, this system can detect patterns and anomalies that indicate a need for maintenance. The integration of TensorFlow for deep learning and Streamlit for interactive web interfaces ensures a user-friendly experience for monitoring and managing the predictive maintenance process.

## Key Features

üõ†Ô∏è **Predictive Maintenance:** Proactively identify maintenance needs before they lead to downtime or failures.

ü§ñ **AI and Machine Learning:** Utilize advanced algorithms to analyze data and predict potential issues.

üîß **Python Implementation:** Develop the system using Python programming language for flexibility and efficiency.

üìä **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitor sensor data in real-time to provide timely maintenance alerts.

üåê **Interactive Interface:** Streamlit-powered web interface for intuitive interaction with the predictive maintenance system.
